# MNIST-Using-Jupyter-Notebook
Classification of MNIST dataset using Jupyter Notebook. There are two two types of neural network used,
- One with Input layer and Ouptput Layer and,
- Other with one additional layer i.e. Hidden Layer
The code check the performance of the model and is an attempt to check the influence of hidden layer on datasets.

# Experiments
The expermiment performed is based on the confusion matrix as follows,

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>With Hidden layer</td>
     <td>without Hidden layer</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
